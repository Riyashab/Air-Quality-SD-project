## Air Quality

Air pollution is one of the world's largest health and environmental challenges. Air pollution expands in two contexts: indoor (household) air pollution and outdoor air pollution.

Air pollution is often defined as the combination of outdoor and indoor particulate matter and ozone. It is a risk factor for many of the leading causes of death, including heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) *(Ritchie and Roser 2019)*.

Unfortunately, over half of the world's population lives without the protection of adequate air quality standards.

Here at home, the air quality outdoors has gotten better since the 1990s, but there are still numerous challenges in safeguarding Americans from air quality issues.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates six pollutants as “criteria” air pollutants using human health-based and environmentally-based criteria.

-   ground-level ozone (OZ)

-   particle pollution (PM2.5 and PM10)

-   carbon monoxide (CM)

-   lead total suspended particulate (TSP)

-   nitrogen oxides (NO2)

-   sulfur dioxide (SD)

### PM2.5 the invisible killer

Among all air pollutants, PM2.5 kills the most people worldwide. It consists of particles smaller than 2.5 microns — small enough that billions of PM2.5 can fit inside a single red blood cell. PM2.5 is responsible for an estimated 4.2 million premature deaths every year globally. This includes over a million deaths in China, over half a million in India, almost 200,000 in Europe, and over 50,000 in the United States *(McGill University 2021)*.

### Analytics to the rescue

Like any other data-driven decision making problem, we can tackle the challenges of air quality using advanced analytics. Business analytics can provide practical insights and aid in the decision-making of strategic decisions concerning air quality and its corresponding health-related issues.

To do so, in this and the next three assignments, we intend to create a complete visual analytics tool to analyze, monitor, and forecast air quality for San Diego County.

## Assignment 1 — Getting to know the air quality data


### Libraries and initial settings

```{r}
library(tidyverse)      # a set of packages for data transformation and visualization
library(here)
library(dplyr) # I am using this library count the number of NA values in a column as well as finding the mean and average deviation
library(ggplot2) # I am using this library to help me plot the differences between PM2.

install.packages("here")
```

[**Assign your first name to the object `first_name` below. Unless your name is majid; in that case: ~~cool name~~ do not change it.**]{style="color: darkorange;"}

```{r}
first_name <- 'riyasha'
```

#### Question 1: Counting the `NA` values

```{r}
# Count NA values in each column of aq_data_riyasha
aq_data_riyasha %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.))))

```

```         
```

```         
```

-   [**Write a brief sentence or two about your finding about the number of `NA`s in each variable.**]{style="color: darkorange;"}

    \- From the data, it shows that the number of NA missing data differs from each column with TSP having the highest missing data 2586.

#### Question 2: Statistical properties of `PM2.5`

-   [**As we mentioned in the description, `PM2.5` is our primary variable of interest. Find the general statistics — average, standard deviation, — of this variable.**]{style="color: darkorange;"}

```{r}
mean(aq_data_riyasha$PM2.5, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(aq_data_riyasha$PM2.5, na.rm = TRUE)
```

-   [**Write a brief sentence or two about your finding about the general statistics of `PM2.5`.**]{style="color: darkorange;"}

\- From the general statistics we found for PM2.5, the avaerage mean is 7.43 with a standard deviation of 3.759 which shows a fair amount of variation in the data provided.

### Visualizing Data

#### Question 3: Pollutants' relationship

-   [**Let's visualize the relationship between `PM2.5` and other pollutants. Create SIX scatter plot along with their corresponding linear trend to visualize the relationship between the other six pollutant (`TSP`, `CM`, `SD`, `NO2`, `OZ`, and `PM10`) and `PM2.5`.**]{style="color: darkorange;"}

-   [**After plotting each visualization, include a sentence or two describing the relationship you observe.**]{style="color: darkorange;"}

**PM2.5 vs TSP :** The scatter plot for PM2.5 vs TSP does not display any data point because of missing values. So, it does not show any relationship between the two variables in this plot.

**PM2.5 vs CM:** The scatter plot shows the relationship between PM2.5 and CM, the data points are scattered around the regression line. It also shows as CM increases the PM2.5 level slightly increases but the relationship is not as strong.

**PM2.5 vs SD:** The scatter plot shows a moderate psotive correlation between PM2.5 and SD. This plot shows to be stronger compared to the variable CM.

**PM2.5 vs N02:** In this scatter plot, data points are clustered towered the lower end of N02 axis with some of them increasing as NO2 increases. The relationship shows significant variability in the data.

**PM2.5 vs OZ:** In this scatter plot are densely clustered in the middle of the OZ with some spread around showing slightly positive relationship.

**PM2.5 vs PM10:** In this scatter plot it shows a strong positive relationship this can be seen by the steep slope of the regression line. As PM10 levels increases the PM2.5 also increases and shows that both are strongly associated and correlation with each other.

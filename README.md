# Air Quality Analysis Project  

## Introduction  
Air pollution is one of the world's largest health and environmental challenges. Air pollution expands in two contexts: indoor (household) air pollution and outdoor air pollution.  

Air pollution is often defined as the combination of outdoor and indoor particulate matter and ozone. It is a risk factor for many of the leading causes of death, including heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) *(Ritchie and Roser 2019)*.

Unfortunately, over half of the world's population lives without the protection of adequate air quality standards.  

## Air Quality Data  
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates six pollutants as ‚Äúcriteria‚Äù air pollutants using human health-based and environmentally-based criteria:  
- Ground-level ozone (OZ)  
- Particle pollution (PM2.5 and PM10)  
- Carbon monoxide (CM)  
- Lead total suspended particulate (TSP)  
- Nitrogen oxides (NO2)  
- Sulfur dioxide (SD)  

### PM2.5: The Invisible Killer  
Among all air pollutants, PM2.5 kills the most people worldwide. It consists of particles smaller than 2.5 microns ‚Äî small enough that billions of PM2.5 can fit inside a single red blood cell. PM2.5 is responsible for an estimated 4.2 million¬†premature deaths¬†every year globally *(McGill University 2021)*.  

## Purpose  
This project creates a **visual analytics tool** to analyze, monitor, and forecast air quality for San Diego County. It tackles the challenges of air quality using advanced analytics and R-based tools.  

## Files Included  
- `data/`: Contains air quality datasets.  
- `scripts/`: R scripts and notebooks for analysis.  
- `images/`: Visualizations and images used in documentation.  
- `assignment1_notebook.Rmd`: Main RMarkdown file for Assignment 1.

## Power BI Analysis

## Power BI Analysis Report

To interact with the full Power BI report, including all visualizations (Overview, Trend Analysis, and Data, Terms, and Definitions), access the link below:

### Key Pages in the Report:
1. **Overview Page**: Geographical distribution of PM2.5 values.
2. **Trend Analysis Page**: Pollutant trends over time with filtering capabilities.
3. **Data, Terms, and Definitions**: Glossary, data sources, and report notes.


To prepare our Microsoft Power BI report, we engaged in all steps of ETL, data modeling, and data visualization.

### ETL Process
1. **Extract**: Air Quality and Site Data were extracted over three years and saved in stable folders.
2. **Transform**: The datasets were cleaned and transformed to ensure 0% errors, including creating an unpivoted version of the Air Quality data.
3. **Load**: Finalized datasets (`Air Quality`, `Site Data`, `Air Quality Unpivoted`) were loaded for analysis.

### Data Modeling
A relational schema was created connecting the three datasets to analyze and display the results effectively.
